## Part II - The Depth of a Bottomless Glass

### Chapter I - Vessel

A round, short, whiskey glass lies on a low table with a mirrorlike black piano finish. The room is lit by sparse and faint spots that create a persistent twilight. A shadowy reflection extends from the cup, grows obscure, and looms forever into the dark surface. The tumbler remains immaculate: crystal clear, not a droplet of sweat, not a single lip mark. Inside, an enticing body of cherry mahogany colour sways - untouched by ice or skin - but made dense by desire.

A man dressed in a fine silk vest and chalk striped dress pants leans over the drink, peering in. He is sitting on a bright red leather couch that encircles most of the table. His legs are spread apart, elbows braced on top of his knees, and hands pulled together. His long, knotty fingers, filled with bulky golden rings, are interlaced and support his skinny face at the same time that hide his downcurved full lips. He resembles a man praying, all but for his stern gaze into the shallow yet endless well of liquor.

People call him Skull.

His legs shift and pace without going anywhere. He feels uneasy being alone in a nightclub with just a single malt for his company. Nowadays, he is more used to filling cups up than emptying them down. Over a year has passed since the last time he drank or partied in any fashion. But tonight, a good friend thought it would be only proper to serve his best barman with a glassfull of the best spirit in the house.

The friend is not there though.

The air is thick with the intense vibrations of electronic music. The surface of the liquid shivers nonstop under the constant humming of the subs, and wobbles rhythmically as the kick hits in precise and powerful bass waves. His ebony skin, tired but wrinkleless, itches with the constant buzz. Still, he hears only the echoing of his own thoughts. *Ow, babe girl...How'd I put a smile in'ya face?* Moments ago, his best efforts provoked nothing but ephemeral laughs. *If I could just gift'y'a smile that last... Just for'ya birthday night...Blondie...*

This is supposed to be a special occasion. Their crew would meet to party together after a long time. They intended to celebrate many things: Skippy's big show, Scarlet's visit to town, Spin's first major gig, and especially Blondie's first birthday party with them. Everyone promised to make this a big night, and toast to their reunion. 

No one else is there though.

He feels disappointed that most people did not show up but time taught him not to sulk about such things. Blondie, on the other hand, did not take this so well.

She left for the washroom a few seconds ago, leaving him with just his thoughts and the glass.

He remembers how reckless he used to be during his teens and has been observing her since the beginning of the night. At first, he just wanted to cheer her up and looked for an opportunity to crack a joke, but soon he started to worry he would need to help her out. Blondie spent most of the time looking toward the door waiting to see someone come in. She paced lethargically and out of rhythm instead of dancing while she drained a bottle of Vodka like water in a hot baking desert. He even saw she asking random people for drugs, although their contacts were out of good stuff and she knew any score was likely to be a bad hit.

He felt helpless, watching it all like a spectator in a horror movie.

*What do I do with'ya babe angel?* He thinks concerned. If someone told him to chill out and take it easy when he was her age, he would only go harder. His dearest desire is to hug her tight like a big brother protecting a little sister from nightmares. He wants to tickle her until endless laughther makes her breathless and incapable of sadness. But life is never so simple. He is not her brother. She is not so little anymore. And even if he manages the tickling, the sorrow will creep back in as soon as he lets her go. He knows as much.

He disentangles his fingers and slides them around his sunken cheeks, reaching up and pressing against his temples as if to hold his head - heavy with worries - from falling inside the alcoholic refuge. 

The low frequencies slow down to a break, and the fluid calms to stillness. The coppery surface mirrors his bony face. He smiles but sees in his image an old enemy: a shadow that hides behind hollow eyes and false grins. He looks deep within, questioning himself. *Ow'ol Skull... How'd'ya let this happen? Been long nights now, since this trickster haunted'ya.*

The man looking back at him from the liquid mirror carries a shade of death in his orbs. A predator invited in by loneliness, devourer of joy and volition.

He saw that same shadow in Blondie's lost gaze tonight.

*Am'I to blame?* He wonders; perhaps his eyes are just a reflection of hers, evoked by a growing weight he carries since they met. 

Violins and chorus of melodic voices build up in the background, and the dancefloor relaxes to a minimal sway, resembling boats in a windless bay. The mood of the tone drifts his mind to the innocent girl she was. He stares into the glass, and through the dark amber lagoon, his restless thoughts sail toward that fateful night years ago.

### Chapter II - Lightning 

The log walls of a narrow pantry resonated to a slow beat coming from the main room. The volume was not loud enough to make the timber vibrate, but the shape of the enclosed space amplified the reverberation and filled the small room with a rhythmical *Vruuuumm*. The sound was a constant reminder of the party going on just beyond the enclosing pile of logs.  *Shit, I've gottta'go* He thought. 

He had work to do, drinks to make.

Right in front of him, a sharp looking guy with a flashy short fedora hat leaned over a low cabinet. At the top of the cabinet lied a silver tray with a glimmering white pearl block the size of a cigarette pack. The guy worked the edge of the cocaine chunk with the agility of a chef. He slid a non-coloured plastic card at a precise angle, gridding quasi-fine dust out of the rock. The solvent smell was strong.

"C'mon now Hats, hurry up with ma'line. I've got'a'bar to run. We're in'shift ya'know." His voice - all groovy and tight - was almost booming in the small pantry.

Hats stopped the grinding and looked up, with a minimal smile on his face, and took a slow breath. He appreciated the second of the pause, a man playing with time like a kid plays with blocks.

"I'm working. You know, right?" Hats asked with an intense and slow cadence that edged toward a threat.

"Don't'ya gi'me that gangsta shit buddy," He said back in a dismissive tone, already halfway to a laugh, "I was ready'rollin'on da'guetho when y'were'till huggin'ur teddy!"

Hats laughed out joining in, his eyes contracting and chest heaving. He turned his face away from the tray barely in time. "Fuck me Skull, that's why I love you." He separated a generous portion from the small pile of dust and slid it to the side. He laid the card flat over the portion and pressed down hard on it while he drew another card from his pocket. "And cause I love you my negga, I serve you properly. You want this to be fine, no little chunks left behind to fucking drip down your throat and spoil your vibe with a gag."

"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! You wanna teach d'priest to preach? Hurry up white boy, I've go'shit to do!"

With a broad grin on his face and a low laugh humming behind his closed teeth, Hats flipped the first card up and scraped all the smashed coke down. "Well, you would never serve me a drink with no ice, would ya?" He chopped the scraped dope with the card once more, making a very fine powder out of it. He played with the card, spreading the white dust to one side and the other, and finally, looking satisfied, he drew one long, uniform and straight line. "Here it is, be my guest and take as much as you want." Hats stepped back, spreading his hands open with palms facing up and pointing to the tray.

He tested his massive nostrils, blocking each side with a finger to find which was working better, stepped in with a pre-rolled bill in his hand, and inhaled the whole line in a slow and steady go. The coke went in with the familiar itching-scratching cold feeling. The smell hinted at ether but had a perfume of its own that echoed pleasure in the deep corners of his mind. His heart was racing before he laid the bill in the tray, but only now that the mild numbness started to spread over the back of his nose, he realised with satisfaction the rush that anteceded the drug itself. *Fuck yeah*

"Jezz! Skull! Are you all right?"

"I'm OK, getting better." He laughed, and Hats followed. "Good shit." He grabbed his glass from a dusty shelve filled with boxes and bottles, took two long steps to the end of the constricted pantry pilled with stacks of boose, opened a small high window for ventilation, and start patting his pockets after a cigarette.

"Yeah, the best there is." Hats repeated the grinding process, working on a line for himself, but looking at him instead of the tray. "That was a big hit, you sure you're OK?"

He knocked his big knuckles on the side of his head. "Just like an ol'V'eight: Bad'on gas, bu'still kicking strong." He lit up, sucked hard on the smoke, and released the cloud toward the open window. His heart pounded in his chest, but his shoulders started to relax. *Goo'shit... And here I'm again.*

"That's a costly engine to run!" Hats said and chuckled before he zipped his nose through the line he had just drawn.

"And that's one of d'many reasons I don't take this ol'dragster to race often." He said, tapping his huge nose with his long knotty index. "But ya'know whi'boy, ya'paying for da'ride, all nigh'long." He took another voluminous puff from the cigarette that hanged from the corner of his mouth and exhaled the smoke through his nose, covering his face in the cloud for a moment. "That's wha'ya'get for buggi'me to blow dope with'ya."

Hats tittered, nodding his head and went back to grinding more out of the brick. "Well, we have been rolling together for some good time now, and every time I offer you a line you'd be like 'perhaps next time' so I was getting daaaaammnn curious about that... I knew you had history with the shit and some more, and since this is going to be a very long night, I figured I would press you on a little bit to see if you would crack." He looked up from the tray with a serious face, eyes locked straight and blank lips. "Now you have me worried if I will have enough." And went back to a constricted laugh.

"Fuck off." He said amidst another cloud of smoke "I'm sure ya'have enough dope there to supply d'whole party." He checked his watch, eyes contracting as he saw the time. "Shouldn't all that be packed before ya'came? I thought ya'had rules about not packing in d'property or something like that."

All the play and joke vanished from Hats face "Yeah, that is true. I came ready, but it's all gone. I wasn't even supposed to be fronting tonight, not this early anyway, but some people are too fucking important to be on time, are they not?" His voice heated up as he talked, almost growing to a shout before calming down. "And this shit is just like running a bar, if there is no beer, many will dig a harder liquor. So here I'm, packing on the pantry, no scale, grinding a block that was supposed to go to someone else. Do you know how much trouble all that is?" Hats finished his rant pointing one of the cards toward him.

"Boy, I don't wanna'no. That's none of ma'business." He swang his head from side to side, contracting his lips "Does da'means ya'not help'in d'bar?" He asked, leaning forward, and took another big puff from the cigarette. He was not concerned about the smoke anymore and started to feel a real need to move.*Fuck, shit's hitting big time, gotta get out of this box.*

"Unless you want me floating coke by your side and through the counter the whole night..."

"Shit no. Ya'know how ma'gig rolls here..." He squeezed the half-smoked cigarette on the sole of his shoe, threw the but out through the window, took a big gulp of the drink, and stepped toward the door. "Just come by every forty-five or so, to keep'm'flying at two hundred plus, cause thi'shit gonna b'intense by'myself."

"Don't you want to just hold on to a pack? On the house, of course." Hats asked bringing a small ziplock up, between his index and middle finger, like a magician holding the card you had. He had many of those ready by now, the powder inside not even close to as finely ground as the lines they just had.

"Ow please, don't. Also, I won't hav'time to draw, and ya'know da'shit ain't fine enough to bump. Ya'served me a good one, now ya'keep it up." He was by the door now, looking Hats right into his eyes. He was walking in clouds, feeling light, fast, alert, and ready to serve hundreds of drinks as if he had four hands.

"Fair enough." Hats said. "I will draw your lines by the side of the fridge then."

He opened a broad, white grin, patted Hats on the shoulder with a wink and walked out of the pantry toward waiting clients in the bar. 

A single line boomed in his mind *Goo'boy, goo'boy.*

### Chapter III - Thunder

*CLACK, CLACK, CLACK!* For an instant, the noise of ice bouncing inside the shaker tin close to his ear was louder than the music. The cold, moist metal felt good in his hands. His heart pounded so strong, and his grip was so tight that he could feel the racing beat in his fingers. *Here we go again...* Coke flashed in his mind like lightning. Life was a storm, and he was the mad captain braving the wind and enjoying the salty splashes in his face, not a frightened sailor holding on to the rocking mast. Next morning he might be the unlikely survivor of wreckage, but that night was scheduled to last for a couple days, and he was not worried about the distant future.

His ship was a roomy, old style kitchen that had been turned into private club bar by raving minds. To his right a line of fridges held an endless stock of canned beers, soda, and water bottles; to his left fluorescent shelves glimmered in the log wall with all the spirits, mixes and liqueurs a drinking guest may desire. Right in front of him, a long, glassy breakfast counter had been turned into bar-front, and a waist-high swinging door separated the kitchen from the main room. Instead of stars, his night was bathed by the purple shine of ultraviolet bulbs. He navigated almost in the dark - a task he made look easy - since he planned the whole deck. 

Like in many other travels he was a one-man crew, and to compensate he moved at double speed. *Tonight we fly ol'boy* Hard would be to stay put under such strong winds. He actually enjoyed being by himself. There was nobody to get in his way, he had lots of space to streamline drinks, and a crowd filled the tip jar with love when they saw a hardworking man cruising like he had four feet and six hands.

He grabbed a glass from the lower countertop under the bar, flipped it up, knocked the shaker at an angle with the outside of his fist to loose the cap and poured the drink. The customer said something that sounded like a "Thanks," but he did not hear. His eyes caught a flash of fiery red in the background, moving toward him, and his mind blocked everything else.*Ow babe, ya'here, at last.* That hair colour was impossible to miss.

A stunning girl approached the bar, curves swaying as she walked and skin slipping through the elusive edges of her clothes. Her eyes tore a hole in his mind. Her intense stare held his sight up - where it should be - but set his desire on fire more than any display of flesh. His passion was a blazing hurricane of taboo, shame and hunger. Like the heat of a bonfire in the middle of the ocean during a cold night, coveted but forbidden above all things.

He opened his best smile and greeted Scarlet. 

"Hellooo Princess! I was starting to fear the pigs got'ya speeding on da'highway again. Waz'up with da'late game?" He half-joked relieved. A speeding ticket was the least of his worries for her.

"Hi Skull, I was cabbing my new friend Blondie over here." She said and nodded toward a girl that hid behind her flame. "Blondie, meet Skull, best drinks you will ever have."

A little girl peered at him with big, scared eyes. She was a porcelain doll, a lucent speck lost in the middle of a constant blur of black forms. "Hi." Was all her gaping, thin pink lips managed to say, followed by a tentative, nervous smile.

*Ow'boy...Ain't da'too far, Scar?* The thought surfaced and was engulfed by incoming high waves.  This was not the first time she brought a new friend from school straight to the bar. Afterall, breaking ice was indeed part of his job. "Hello, hello. I see da'palace's been spawning fine ladies as always. Skull at your services, Blondie." He said, forcing his grin further and bowing with a waiting open hand as part of the act.

She extended her tiny, timid fingers to hold on to his, like a mermaid - afraid, but curious to touch the sailor's inviting palm. He kissed her pale skin with naive lips, making a flourish with his other hand. The perfect image of an uncle playing knight and princess with his little niece. The child in her laughed and relaxed, lowering the guard. And he followed with his play. "So, what can this humble servant do for ya?"

"First, you can cut the royalty crap out." Scarlet said, slapping her hand on the reflective surface of the counter." Or I will step on you like a queen, see how you like that." Her eyebrows contracted in an expression that was clearly forced. "Then, you can get me the usual, and Blondie over here will have that bubbly, sweet stuff you always brag about."

"She sounds like a queen alright!" He said amidst a cackle and knocked his fingertips on the counter, moving his hand toward hers while he cooked another joke. He was not one to let a chance pass, and the little restraint that kept his tongue in check most of the time had been blown out of him tonight. "But ya know, that sounds not bad at all. I guess, I'd enjoy your tiny white feet walking over me, and everything else..." He licked the corner of his lips and in an afterthought threw a mocking grin to compensate.

Scarlet's face became serious. *Too much?* He thought for a second, but as she answered she held back a smile, and her tone was that of veiled laughter. "You keep dreaming! Now hurry up, cause I'm fucking thirsty!"

"As you command!" He saluted, playing on."One Palace Crasher and a Maiden's Bullet. Shall I bill the treasury?" He mocked, referring to her ongoing unlimited tab, responsible for half the holes in liquor bookkeeping.

"You can bet all your dope on that." Scarlet said in a dismissive tone. 

The girl seemed to shrink even more when she heard that. She kept looking at the sides as if trying to figure out where the hell she had ended up and apparently making an effort to stay in there. *Time to pull da ol'trick* 

"OK, all I need is to see some ID from your friend." He said and moved his gaze slowly from Scarlet to the girl while he put his best serious-professional mask in play.

Blondie froze in place, so startled that she stopped breathing and for a second there he thought she would just turn and leave. *That's telling.* Most teens would come up with a poor lie at least, but the girl had no malice in her. Not wanting to hold her uncomfortable for too long, he looked back to Scarlet and opened an exaggerated smile as a cue. The laughter began forced but caught up into actual heaving that soon left him breathless.

Once they were done laughing and had played around the prank some more, the girl seemed to relax a little. Nothing like the subtle reminder that this was just the place for breaking some rules.

While they fooled around a small line formed behind the girls with thirsty partygoers pacing to the music. Mindful of his work, he pointed to the next in line, and as the customer stepped in, the girls moved to the side. Mindful of his work, he pointed to the next in line, and as the customer stepped in, the girls moved to the side. Back to high wind, he repeated the procedure until he had all orders. Most people wanted simple things that he could streamline in a breeze and be done with ten drinks in the time most bartenders took to tend to two. The detailed cocktails scarlet had asked for were the real work, and he wanted the line empty again so they could keep on talking. That way he did his job of making everybody happy.

Once he had all orders neatly organised in his mind, he set sail. The manoeuvrings of the bar were drilled so deep in him that everything was mechanical. He strode to the freezer, grabbed all beers and waters in a tray, and set them grouped by orders in the counter. Then, he dipped a bunch of short glasses from the low shelf into his ice cooler, lined them together, and worked two bottles at the same time, counting the seconds for doses instead of measuring in shots. In goes the mixes, on top land lemon slices and cherries and straws. Finally, he spread the drinks to their grouped orders, and everything was ready for delivery at the same time. Cash comes in, coins go back; metals and paper hit the tip jar hard, thanks to a bunch of people satisfied by speed and generous doses, and he was done.

Now came the real fun. True work. Artmaking.

These cocktails were not on any menu. They were his beloved creations, and on a busy night, he would probably deny they even existed because he had no real time to make them.

He grabbed the assemblage of liquors, juices and fruits he needed, placed everything on a side table under the shelves and worked on Scarlet drink first. He took it to her and went back to the far fridge to get the bottle of sparkling wine he would need for the next. 

Maiden's bullet was a name that came from a series of dirty jokes revolving around the strong but smooth cocktail he designed to please sensitive paladars and soak brains in alcohol at the same time. He packed a bunch of different berries with sugar and mint and muddled them hard until all the juice came out and the mass was jam-like. Then, he filled the shaker tin with ice and lots of vanilla vodka, shook the hell out of it and strained the content on a high glass until it was tree fifths full. He left the leftovers on the tin so he could skip that troublesome step for the next one. *They always wan'more.* Finally, he topped the glass with sparkling wine and drove a long thin straw with two cherries inside.

He came back to the counter just in time to see Scarlet shoving Hat's drink away from Blondie's reaching hand who looked at him with a dreamy face. *Typical... Well, perfect timing, I guess.* He placed the cocktail in her hand with the care and satisfaction of someone filling the last gap in a puzzle.

Blondie took a second to realise she was holding the drink, then her face lit with a small glimmer of surprise, and she sipped. He stayed there, just looking at her, waiting for the magic to happen. As she savoured her expression brightened up, and her lips went back to the glass, drinking with thirst. *There we go, another hit* A natural smile curled her lips for a moment, and just when he thought it was about to broaden the smile vanished into a gaping mouth that depicted another kind of surprise entirely. 

Her eyes were fixed on the counter. 

He turned his face just in time to catch Hats inhaling a line and extending a roled bill across the bar. *Fuck me Hats, subtle as a fuckin'canon ball. And to think I just told'ya not to mess with ma'bar.* His good vibe was gone and left in place a mild paranoia. He first stared hard at Hats and then moved his eyes around sweeping the scene to see if there was anyone close by who could not be there while that happened. The immediacies of the bar were empty; the night was still slow, and all faces within eyesight were known and safe. The only thing he saw that disturbed him was a shaky Blondie pouring more down her throat. *Ow boy...that's fast.*

While Scarlet and Hats discussed the quality of the coke with a tone typical to their unresolved past relationship, he kept peering for incoming trouble and watching the petrified girl holding on to the glass as if it was a lifeline. He started to feel anxious about the whole situation and decide it was probably a good moment to offer a solution for the impasse.

"Ya know, if ya girls gonna keep staring at it, I sure can use a fix." He said in a comic tone while he actually thought -*Le'me blow thi'shit and b'done with this fast.*

Hats followed up on the joke, and he teased back. While they laughed, Scarlet took a deep, theatrical breath and leaned closer looking resolved to blow everything into the air. Something reacted in him quicker than thought - a deep impulse that ignored the clear signs of an old joke - and before he knew, he was moving to try and stop her.

She inhaled one line, and all he could do was regret moving in the first place *Too late, ya'fell for it.*

"I wish you could see the look on your faces. Junkies." Came the inevitable mock from Scarlet.

They all cackled hard. Even laughing, he still looked at Blondie from the corner of his eyes. The girl stared ahead with a blank face and drank once more as if she hoped to find something hidden at the bottom.

Scarlet turned to her and asked if she wanted some. He could almost see her hand shaking while she clutched the glass. Blondie looked around without focusing on anything; shoulders and lips contracted while she made tense, slow movements. For a moment he thought she would just wave her head in denial. Her image, struggling with the pressure, was so hopeless that he even wished for the mute gesture. Instead, she tilted the glass and drained the rest of the liquid.*Damn.* 

She slammed the glass right in front of him and grabbed the rolled bill.

He froze at that gesture feeling uneasy. All breeze - good and bad - was gone from him for a minute. A speck of conscience resurfaced and imprinted that image in his memory. He gazed at the bottom of the empty glass and wondered if she had found courage, desire or just numbness.

### Chapter IV - Shock

The bass drops like a stone in a placid lake and shatters the ephemeral mirror with powerful sound waves. The reflection of his face fades away, and the dancefloor jumps back into action, cherishing the return of the beat. The growing crowd smiles and punches the air, pacing to the hypnotic rhythim.

He wakes from the reverie with the phantasm of the empty glass hovering atop his untouched one.

The old jokes about the Bullet echo in his head stripped of fun and make him feel sick. He should not have served her that night. *Would that have changed anything?* He tries to believe it would not. But no amount of rationalisation is enough to push away the disconfort that builds up on his stomach. After months feeling restless about his part in Blondie's self destructive path, he has nowhere else to run. The tension within grows into pain - a trapped animal trying to climb out from his depths. Burning claws scratch their way up through his esophagos, willing to come out as srieks and tears.

His hands shake as he holds down the urge to scream. A splash of wisky wobbles out of the glass and falls on his skin. The dropplets whisper to him *Lick me... Drink me... Drown your pain on me.*

He leans forward toward the numbness promised by the dark amber lake held in his hands. His nose plays above the edge, taking deep breaths from the aromathic fumes. The burning inside him writhes in antecipation, wishful and fearful at the same time. He wants to jump in, drain it all in a single gulp and head to the bar for a bottle that will keep him swiming in confort through this hard night. *I could do this. Just tonight, just to endure the sight of her sadness, and to hold back my own.*

The beat calms down once more, allowing the dancers to rest for a momment and refill empty glasses on the bar. The loud laugherther from a party seating on the next booth breaks through the music and draws his attention. 

A sinnuous brunnet in a tight blue dress points a finger out and shouts, "Here it comes!" Her full lips open in a wide grin, flashing perfect white teeth.

He follows her finger and sees a server in a funnel black dress approaching with a tray filled with shots. 

The group celebrates her approach, and they proceede to toast and shug shot after shot. A moment latter the server turns back, carrying the tray with a colection of empty glasses toward the bar. On her way back, she throws a side glance his way, first checking his drink to see if she was needed, then looking at his eyes, sporting a shy smile and noding before resuming towards the bar. The group laugher comes back even louder, with every cheerful face more ecxited than before. They jump from their seats and head to the dancefloor.

His eyes dart back to the voluptuous mahogamy surface.

*What kind of company am I? That won't even toast and drink to a friend's birthday.* Those people would party hard tonight, endure a Sunday hangover, and fall back in line for their ordinary lives on Monday morning. For most of them, alcohol was just a placid lake for a relaxing swim. *Ow boy, can I stay in the shallows just this night?* He sways the glass a bit, staring at the wavering liquid, and wonders if those waves will turn into a binge tide, dragging him to the depths he avoids.

*Oh fuck it! Maybe it will help put a smile on her face...* He angles the glass to his lips, and the first sip of old single malt touches his tongue like honey and silk, carresing its way down his troath to meet with the hungry beast that awaits for the calming nectar. 

There's a brief moment of rejoice.

The silk fades, the sweetness turns bitter and a stinging heat rises all the way from his stomach to his mouth. After such a long time abstinent, his palate is unnused to the liquor's edge. With a grimace, he backs away from the glass, startled.

The shock is like a gust of warm wind blowing against the sails of his mind, and he drifts off toward his first memory with the burning liquid.
