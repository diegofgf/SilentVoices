# First reflections after almost a year...

I must finish this book, or I'm finished.

Comming back after so long is like walking a road you have only been as a child. There's familiarity, but you can't remember if the path follows left or right. Certainty only comes back once you have taken a few steps and concludes it was the other way. But little by little the feeling of comming home grows, doubt recedess and every next step grows more confident, the footing solid.
